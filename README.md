## Amazavr Sales Performance Analysis - Research Plan & Approach
### Objective: 
The primary goal of this analysis is to evaluate sales performance by identifying the top-selling products and assessing the contribution of different product categories to overall revenue. This insight will help Amazavr optimize inventory allocation and refine marketing strategies.  
### Key Analytical Steps 
1. Data Understanding & Preparation
- Load and inspect the dataset for completeness and accuracy.
- Check for missing or inconsistent values, especially in key columns (Monthly Sales, Monthly Revenue, Category).
- Convert the Month column from string format to a date/time format for time-based analysis.
- Ensure numerical values (Unit Price, Monthly Revenue, etc.) are formatted correctly. 
4. Identify Best-Selling Products
- Rank products based on Monthly Sales and Monthly Revenue.
- Identify the top 3 best-selling products based on revenue and compare them to those with the highest unit sales.
- Analyze whether high sales volume correlates with high revenue, or if premium-priced products contribute more to overall sales. 
5. Category Performance Evaluation 
- Calculate total revenue per category to determine the most profitable categories.
- Compute average sales value per category to understand category contribution. 
6. Sales Trends Over Time 
- Analyze monthly sales trends to identify seasonal fluctuations or growth patterns.
- Determine if specific product categories experience peak sales in certain months.
- Assess if any external factors (e.g., holiday seasons, promotions) influence sales performance. 
7. Impact of Discounts on Sales
- Evaluate how Discount % correlates with Monthly Sales and Monthly Revenue.
- Identify whether higher discounts effectively drive sales volume or result in reduced profit margins.
- Assess if discount strategies should be optimized to balance revenue and profitability. Assumptions & Considerations
- Sales data is assumed to be accurate and representative of actual performance.
- External market factors affecting sales trends are not included in this analysis.
- High revenue does not always indicate high profitabilityâ€”storage costs and discounts must be considered.
- Customer preferences and product lifecycle trends should be factored in for deeper insights. 
This structured approach will provide actionable insights into product and category performance, helping Amazavr optimize sales strategies and inventory planning.
